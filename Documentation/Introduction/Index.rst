Introduction
============


What does it do?
----------------

This extension helps to maintain your TYPO3 installation and / or to improve the privacy of your
customers by deleting old files in specific intervals. It uses the scheduler delivered with TYPO3.


**Note** :
This extension was tested carefully on multiple servers and TYPO3 installations and should work as expected.
I would recommend to do some tests in your specific environment by using the $this->debugging variable.

**Note** :
This extension will remove a file from FAL index but will NOT check if it's still in use!
